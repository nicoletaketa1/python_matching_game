This is a 6x6 matching game, adapted from a school project that was a 5x5 matching game.

When run, the cards are originally flipped over. 
Click on any two cards to flip them over.
If they match, a red x will be drawn over them.
If they don't, they'll both be flipped back over.

Once all of the cards are matched, then the border will
change color and you can click anywhere on the screen to exit
